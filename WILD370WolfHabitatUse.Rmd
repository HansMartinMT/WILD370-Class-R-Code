## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Load necessary packages for analysis.
```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#function to install and load required packages
ipak <- function(pkg){
  new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
  if (length(new.pkg)) 
    install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
  sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

#load or install these packages:
packages <- c("ks", "lattice", "plotrix", "adehabitatHR", "maptools", "foreign", "rgdal", "sp", "raster",
              "ggplot2","colorRamps","rgeos","leaflet","lubridate", "htmlwidgets","move")

#run function to install packages
ipak(packages)
```
Load wolf GPS Collar Data from Banff National Park
```{r}
datawolf<-read.csv("C:/Users/Hans Martin/Documents/R_Data/WILD370Project/wolfkde.csv")
```

Look at the first 6 lines of the data:
```{r}
head(datawolf)
```

As you can see, the GPS data for these wolves has already been linked with Habitat Data. These data include the landcover type: landcover16, Elevation, Distance from Human Access, and habitat suitability indexes for the 5 ungulate species that occur in Banff National park. 

Before we begin to analyze the data, it may help to have a visualization of what the data looks like.
```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
wolfyht<-shapefile("C:/Users/Hans Martin/Documents/R_Data/WILD370Project/wolfyht.shp")
head(wolfyht)
str(wolfyht)
```

Now lets plot the data so you can get a feel for the landscape that these animals are living in.

```{r}

# base plot of wolf packs by color with legend

plot(wolfyht@data$EASTING,wolfyht@data$NORTHING, col=c("red","blue")[wolfyht@data$PackID],ylab="Northing",xlab="Easting")
legend(555000,5742500,unique(wolfyht@data$Pack),col=c("blue","red"),pch=1)
```
